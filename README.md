# OrbitAI
An AI Assistant that creates a solar system representative of your many tasks.

Current State: All task related features (addition, removal, alterations) have been added to the app. Nothing with AI has been setup yet as I am in the progress of learning how to make use of my OpenAI account. This will be tricky because each call to the API will cost me. However, with the pricing being decently low I will gladly spend an accumulated $20 maximum to learn how to incorporate AI features in an app.
